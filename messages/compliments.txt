You have very smooth hair.
You deserve a promotion.
Good effort!
What a fine sweater!
I like your style.
Your T-shirt smells fresh.
I love what you've done with the place.
You are like a spring flower; beautiful and vivacious.
Well done!
I like those shoes more than mine.
Great!
Fantastic work!
Way to go!
You're tremendous!
You deserve a compliment!
Your smile is breath taking.
How do you get your hair to look that great?
Take a break; you've earned it.
I would share my dessert with you.
I love the way you click.
You're invited to my birthday party!
All of your ideas are brilliant!
You make my data circuits skip a beat.
You are the gravy to my mashed potatoes.
You get an A+!
I like you more than the smell of Grandma's home-made apple pies.
Let's do this again sometime!
You're so smart!
You're pretty groovy, dude.
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
I told all my friends about how cool you are.
You're #1 in my book!
Well played.
You could probably lead a rebellion.

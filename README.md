Ideas
-----
- Mash up Tourism data with other data to help plan a tourist's trip to Canberra on the go.
- Use Energy consumption for different appliance data, work out how much energy your househould consumes, suggest better appliances, and where you can go to buy them.  Calculate how much you could save.
- Mash up Tourism data with development of government buildings and Trove, create a Canberra history experience.  Inspired by Vintage Canberra.  Use Gazetter to work out which year where you are started getting developed.

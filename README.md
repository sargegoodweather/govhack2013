How much damage is your television doing?

Intergrating synergistic dataflows to empower consumer decision making and draw social attention to being green.

Using live data from http://opendata.linkdigital.com.au/dataset/appliance-energy-ratings as well as static information from global research, we inform consumers about their television's behaviour and the hidden costs they incur, while suggesting better alternatives where possible.

The Australian Government has an energy rating tool for televisions, but, face it: how often have you looked at it? Have you ever come across it? It's tucked away on the [web](http://reg.energyrating.gov.au/comparator/product_types/32/search/). Our goal is to thrust the problem of energy efficiency of appliances in the limelight, by allowing users to enter information about their television(s) and have their energy efficiency rated in the public domain: the user is given a score which is posted to Facebook for their friends to see.
